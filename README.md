This is the Verilog parser library used by VerilogCreator. The library produces the AST used to crossref and navigate a Verilog project. The parser supports Verilog 05 (full IEEE 1364-2005) and subset of SystemVerilog 12 (IEEE 1800-2012). See https://github.com/rochus-keller/VerilogCreator/blob/master/README.md for more information.

The library makes use of a parser generated by Coco/R based on input from EbnfStudio (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio). There is no other dependency than the Qt Core library.

In order to regenerate CocoParser.cpp/h you have to use this version of Coco/R: https://github.com/rochus-keller/Coco

### To do's
